  <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
  <p>Lafia is the capital city of Nasarawa State in north-central Nigeria.
    It was founded in the late 18th century by Muhammadu Dunama, on the site south of Shabu village.
    In the late 19th century under ruler Mohamman Agwai (1881-1903) the Lafia market became an important trade centre in
    the
    Benue Valley; the town later became part of the British colonial structure in 1903.
    The city is multi-ethnic with inhabitants including Kanuri, Fulani, Gwandara, Alago, Migilli (Koro) and Hausa,
    making it
    “a miniature Nigeria” in one description.</p>
