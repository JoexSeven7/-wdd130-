  <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
  <p>Lagos began as a small Yoruba fishing and farming settlement called Eko, founded by the Awori people in the 15th
    century. The name Lagos was later given by Portuguese traders who arrived around the 1470s they named it after a
    coastal town in Portugal (“Lagos” meaning “lakes”). By the 18th and 19th centuries, Lagos became a major
    slave-trading port, attracting British intervention. In 1851,
    the British bombarded the city (the “Reduction of Lagos”) and later annexed it in 1861, turning it into a British
    colony. Lagos grew rapidly under colonial rule, becoming Nigeria's capital city in 1914. Though the capital moved to
    Abuja
    in 1991, Lagos remains Nigeria's commercial powerhouse, tech hub, and most populous city over 20 million people
    strong.Its blend of cultures Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Brazilian, and global influences makes it a living symbol of
    Nigeria's diversity and ambition.</p>
