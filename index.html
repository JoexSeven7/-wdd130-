        <h2>Lagos</h2>
        <img src="images/nigeria.jpg" alt="Mycountry">
        <p>Lagos was founded by the Awori people in the 15th century as "Eko" before becoming a major slave trade port
            after
            Portuguese explorers arrived. The British annexed it as a colony in 1861 to suppress the slave trade, and it
            became the
            capital of British Nigeria in 1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960 with Lagos as its capital, until the
            capital
            moved to Abuja in 1991, though Lagos remains a vital commercial and cultural hub.</p>
